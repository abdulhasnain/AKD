        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality">Augmented reality</a> is an important pillar of Industry 4.0 and it has applications in sectors like Industrial, Education, social media, Tourism, Gaming, Retail, Medical, Entertainment, etc. The use cases of AR are more prominent in other sectors compared to the Industrial sector, but AR has far more things to give in the industrial sector, if used to its true potential. The main challenge is the integration of AR in industry is relatively new and slow and there is a lack of Knowledge and standardisation for development of AR experiences in this sector. The objective of this paper is to provide a detail overview of a sample or prototypical industrial-use AR experience and the tools used to develop that experience. The sample AR experience are built on maintenance of Diesel gen-set and maintenance of a Cone-crusher. It gives basic procedural steps for AR experience Development and also talks about the software and their alternatives to some extent.
